# tempeRing

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of tempeRing is to provide an R package for my Summer Tempering project at the Warwick Statistics CDT. 

The package allows a user to run several MCMC methods, with a focus in Parallel Tempering and Annealing for multimodal targets. 

Available methods include: 

(@) Random Walk Metropolis
(@) Simulated Tempering (ST) 
(@) Parallel Tempering/Replica Exchange methods with several dynamics:

    1. Standard naive implementation
    2. Reversible dynamics via Stochastic Even-Odd swaps (SEO) 
    3. Non-reversible dynamics via Deterministic Even-Odd swaps (DEO) *à la* **Okabe (see also Syed)**
    4. Accelarated Tempering for symmetric targets via QuanTA transformations *à la* **Tawn**
    5. Weight-Preservation via Hessian Adjusted Targets (HAT) *à la* **Tawn and Roberts**

(@) Parallel Annealing with both reversible and non-reversible dynamics:

    1. Annealed Leap-Point Sampler (ALPS)
    2. Non-Reversible ALPS via DEO

Emphasis is on allowing us to see the methods in action on illustrative toy examples and not in performance (e.g. everything is coded in R so far) but an effort was made on making the R code as efficient as possible. Faster implementations and extensions to Python and Julia are on the horizon.
