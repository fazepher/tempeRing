Description: The goal of tempeRing is to provide an R package for my Summer Tempering project 
    at the Warwick Statistics CDT. The package allows a user to run several MCMC methods, 
    with a focus in Parallel Tempering and Annealing for multimodal targets. Available methods include 
    both non-reversible and reversible swap dynamics for Parallel Tempering/Replica Exchange and 
    Annealed Leap-Point Sampling (ALPS), as well as Simulated Tempering and Random Walk Metropolis.
