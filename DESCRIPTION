Description: The goal of tempeRing is to provide an R package for my Summer Tempering project at the Warwick Statistics CDT. The package allows a user to run several MCMC methods, with a focus in Parallel Tempering and Annealing for multimodal targets. 
    Available methods include both non-reversible and reversible swap dynamics for Parallel Tempering/Replica Exchange and Annealed Leap-Point Sampling (ALPS), as well as Simulated Tempering and Random Walk Metropolis.
